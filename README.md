# About
This repository contains the code for a project that aims to predict coronary artery disease using neural networks. The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which classifies coronary artery disease. The code includes data preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation steps. The model is built using Keras Sequential API and the data preprocessing includes handling categorical variables and missing values. The evaluation of the model is done using various metrics and confusion matrix visualization.
